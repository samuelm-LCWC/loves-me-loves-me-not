# Loves me, loves me not...

"Loves me, loves me not" is a traditional game in which a person plucks off all the petals of a flower one by one, saying the phrase _"Loves me"_ and _"Loves me not"_ when determining whether the one that they love, loves them back.

Given a number of petals, return a string which repeats the phrases _"Loves me"_ and _"Loves me not"_ for every alternating petal, and return the last phrase in **all caps**. Remember to put a comma and space between phrases.

## Examples:
```
loves_me(3) ➞ "Loves me, Loves me not, LOVES ME"

loves_me(6) ➞ "Loves me, Loves me not, Loves me, Loves me not, Loves me, LOVES ME NOT"

loves_me(1) ➞ "LOVES ME"
```

## Notes:
* Remeber to return a _string_
* The first phrase is always _"Loves me"_
